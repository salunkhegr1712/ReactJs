// so the ternary operator is basically a one line if else statement 
// so for that you should know the difference between the expression and the statement

// the control flow statements like if-else pair for while are the statements
// and ternary operator is one which is a basic ifelse statement but it is an expression 

// Syntax

// (condition)? condition is true then do this : condition is false then do this 

let a=100;let b=100

// such like below you can able to use the ternary operators easily and wisely 

a>b?console.log("a is bigger than b"):console.log("b is bigger than a")
a===b?console.log("a is equal to b"):console.log("a is not equal b")
